# Instructions for Conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for StudyBloom Application

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Environment Preparation
- Ensure the StudyBloom application is deployed and accessible
- Prepare test accounts with different user roles if applicable
- Have the UAT questionnaire ready for each participant
- Set up a quiet testing environment with necessary devices
- Prepare screen recording software (optional) for detailed analysis

### 2. Participant Selection
- Recruit 5-8 participants representing your target user demographic
- Ensure participants have varying levels of technical expertise
- Schedule individual testing sessions (30-45 minutes each)
- Obtain consent for recording and data collection if needed

## During Testing Session

### 1. Introduction (5 minutes)
- Welcome the participant and explain the purpose of the testing
- Assure them that you're testing the application, not their abilities
- Explain that you want honest feedback and that criticism is welcome
- Briefly explain the main features they'll be testing
- Have them sign any necessary consent forms

### 2. Task-Based Testing (25-30 minutes)
Guide participants through these key tasks:

#### Authentication Tasks:
- Ask them to create a new account (if they don't have one)
- Have them log in with their credentials
- Request them to update their profile information

#### AI Processing Tasks:
- Ask them to upload a sample document (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Have them use the AI summarization feature
- Request them to review and evaluate the AI-generated content

#### Reminder System Tasks:
- Ask them to create a new study reminder
- Have them view their existing reminders
- Request them to edit or delete a reminder

#### Collections Management Tasks:
- Ask them to create a new study collection
- Have them organize materials within the collection
- Request them to access and review their collections

#### General Navigation:
- Ask them to navigate between different sections of the app
- Have them find specific features they might use for studying

### 3. Observation Guidelines
- Observe without providing help unless they're completely stuck
- Take notes on difficulties, errors, or confusion
- Note which tasks take longer than expected
- Pay attention to facial expressions and verbal reactions
- Ask follow-up questions about specific experiences

### 4. Questionnaire Completion (10-15 minutes)
- Have participants complete the UAT questionnaire
- Allow them to elaborate on any responses if they wish
- Ask for specific examples of issues they encountered
- Gather suggestions for improvements

## Post-Testing Activities

### 1. Data Collection
- Collect completed questionnaires
- Compile observation notes
- Review any screen recordings
- Document any technical issues that occurred

### 2. Analysis
- Compile quantitative data from rating scales
- Categorize qualitative feedback
- Identify common issues or suggestions
- Prioritize issues based on frequency and impact
- Create a summary report of findings

### 3. Follow-up (if needed)
- Contact participants for clarification if needed
- Share results summary with participants (optional)
- Plan for subsequent testing rounds if necessary

## Best Practices

### For Test Facilitators:
- Remain neutral and avoid leading questions
- Don't take negative feedback personally
- Encourage participants to think aloud
- Be patient and allow time for exploration
- Thank participants for their valuable feedback

### For Participants:
- Use the application as you would in real life
- Don't worry about making mistakes
- Share honest opinions and experiences
- Ask questions if you're unsure about something
- Take your time to explore features

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Technical Problems:
- Have backup devices ready
- Prepare alternative access methods
- Keep technical support contact information available
- Document any technical issues for development team

### Participant Issues:
- If a participant is struggling, allow them to move to the next task
- Reassure participants that difficult tasks indicate interface problems
- Note if multiple participants struggle with the same feature

## Success Metrics

### Usability Goals:
- 80% of participants should complete core tasks successfully
- Average task completion time should be within acceptable limits
- User satisfaction scores should be above 3.5/5
- Number of errors per task should be minimal
- Participants should express willingness to recommend the application

## Deliverables

After completing UAT sessions, prepare:
- Summary report of findings
- List of prioritized issues for development
- User feedback compilation
- Recommendations for improvements
- Success/failure metrics against goals
